Tebex is an online store provider for Minecraft Servers and a variety of other games. Tebex have a proprietary plugin called BuyCraft that allows the delivery of virtual products to players through running in-game commands, like the assignment of ranks. 

Tebex can be used via their website and their online store panel, to create products, administrate purchases and to set what commands should be run when a package is purchased or when a chargeback is initiated. 

Tebex acts as the merchant handling payment services, requiring players to pay Tebex then Tebex pays you. 

There are 2 plans available. A free plan and a Paid Plan. The Paid plan comes with more features but at a monthly cost. Both plans require you to give Tebex 10% of the package sales. Take this into account when administrating packages.
